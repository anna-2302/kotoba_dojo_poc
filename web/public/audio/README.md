# Audio Files Directory

## Expected Files

- `lofi-ambient.mp3` - Main ambient lo-fi track for study sessions

## Adding Audio

1. Download a royalty-free lo-fi music track
2. Save it as `lofi-ambient.mp3` in this directory
3. Recommended length: 3-10 minutes (will loop automatically)

## Recommended Sources

See `AUDIO_SETUP.md` in the project root for download sources and licensing information.

## Testing Without Audio

The audio player will function without the audio file present. It will:
- Show all controls
- Allow user interaction
- Display console warnings (expected)
- Not crash the application

Add the audio file for full functionality.
